a binary search tree is data structures using self referential lists where we can find data in a manner close to the binary search algorithm

value in left sub-tree is less than or equal to key at current node and values in right sub-tree is equal or greater than value of key at current node.

- head node must be pointed to by a pointer
- same as linked list, all nodes are accessed by pointers , allocated in heap memory
- for an empty BST, the head pointer will have nullptr value
