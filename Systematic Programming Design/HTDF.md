### 1- write the input and output in its type format
	int -> int
### 2- write the description of the function
	function takes number and return double the value
### 3- Function Stub
	a syntatically correct function call with a dummy result at the end
	its purpose is to enable the test checks to run
	---> I as mina on't see much value in stub right now
### 4-define examples
	in BSL->	;;(double 0) should return 0
			;;(double 1) should return 2
	in Cpp	//double(3) should return 6 
			//double(6) should return 12
### 5-Template
	the template shows you the raw material the function is dealing with
	ex: (define (double n)
		(...n))		----> here it tells that it deals with n and outputs some calc of n
